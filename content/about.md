## About Kaj Kandler

This Eleventy Starter Project has been developed and documented by [Kaj Kandler](https://kajkandler.com/)

Kaj Kandler is an expert in [Digital Persona Optimization (DPO)](https://entitygarden.com/glossary/digital_persona_optimization/). He lives in Berlin, Germany.
Mr. Kandler helps solo professionals, coaches and public speakers to be visible in Google Search and AI chat bots. He elevates their personal brand through clarity and consistency of message.
Kaj helps public personas build a brand that search engines understand. Search engines like Google Search will recognize consistent information as factual. Google shows a rich knowledge panel for the brand based on factual information.

Kaj Kandler works with static site generators since his times at [Conficio](https://conficio.com), which he generated with [Apache Cocoon](https://cocoon.apache.org/). In 2025 he discovered [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (11ty) and migrated the websites [kajkandler.com](https://kajkandler.com/) and [Entity Garden](https://entitygarden.com) from [Blurry](https://github.com/blurry-dev/blurry). The main reason to migrate was the possibility to implement efficiently [schema markup](https://schema.org/) through the [Data Cascade](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-cascade/).

<!-- ## About the 11ty Meetup

Kaj Kandler published this 11ty Starter Project to present his methods to integrate schema markup at the 11ty Meetup. Anyone interested is invited to join the meetup and ask questions.
